Private Horton# Misson report, infiltration failed, all hostile units eliminated, I'm the only one survivor on the squad, the others didn't make it, data secured, on route to the shuttle. 
Shuttle# Copy that, the shuttle is unable pass through the astroids, you are gonna have to use your jetpack. 
Private Horton# They're all dead, all because of me. 
Shuttle# It's not your fault, our intelligence showed the defense was weak here, we weren't expecting that. Now our priority is to secure the data to the Reckless, shuttle out. 
Private Horton# Damn it, not only I got them killed, now I'll have to do spacewalk.
