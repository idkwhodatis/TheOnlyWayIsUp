Crew# Captain, we have an incoming transmission, it seems it's from...General Wallace's flag ship. 
Captain Jhonson# Put him on.
General Wallace# Captain Jhonson, good to see you safe and sound.
Captain Jhonson# Let's save the small talks, cuz I wonder why a earth's general's flag ship would be here alone in enemy's territory.
General Wallace# So let's get to the point then.
General Wallace# Captain Jhonson, the Earth United Nations council has agreed to truce with Jupiter Empire, and what you did here would significantly damage the truce. 
General Wallace# I'm going to arrest you for treason, and claim that what you did here was personal and not on order of the Earth United Nations.
Captain Jhonson# You can't do this, we are on the same boat. 
Captain Jhonson# You drag me into this, you gave me the order. 
General Wallace# Seems you are a little confused about the current situation. 
General Wallace# I will give you two options, surrender and go back to earth for trial, or resist and being destroied.
Captain Jhonson# Everything I did, I do it for the interest of Earth.
General Wallace# Time's ticking.
Captain Jhonson# I can surrender if you can guarantee my crews's safety.
General Wallace# Your crews will be fine, as long as they are willing to identify your crime, you have my word.
