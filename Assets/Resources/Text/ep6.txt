Agent# Still don't wanna talk huh?
Private Horton# I would never betray Captain Jhonson, like what you did to him. 
Agent# Whoa whoa, careful, his not a captain anymore. He's just like you, except in a different cell.
Private Horton# Great way to treat a veteran solider who served Earth for decades.
Agent# Mr Jhonson is a criminal who committed treason, but you are different, you still get the chance to have a normal life.
Agent# All you need to do is to say a little words, and you will be breathing fresh air again.
Private Horton# In a country like this? I would rather breathe the smell of urine in my cell. 
Agent# Think about this, he chose to plead guilty, in exchange of his crews innocence, he wanted you to do this, are you gonna let him down?
Private Horton# There's nothing you can get from me. 
Agent# Well, if that is the case, the testimony is flawless anyways. What a waste of time huh?
Agent# Stubborn loser, enjoy your life in the cell. 
Private Horton# ...
Private Horton# This will not end like this...
